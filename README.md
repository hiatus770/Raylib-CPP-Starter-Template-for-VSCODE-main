# Raycaster Thing! 

This is my 2D raycaster project created using Raylib, this uses some more advanced techniques for ray marching and was programmed in good old C++. 
I used stepping techniques for my program which improved its efficiency by huge amounts.

I used the above algorithm from a youtube video and implemented it into my program in order to make it run at mucher igher frame rates. 


Heres an example from the program running with a custom texture loaded onto the tiles!
